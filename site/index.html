<!-- 
  Things to do:
    Main Page: 
      Add description block 
      Make the buttons a quarter circle * 
        - Add a button in the middle to start the game 
        - Once the button is activated the text will be replaced by how 
          much does the player have in a round (aka do a timer)
      Find a background color that doesn't hurt your eyes (pls no white)
      Inside of the buttons should be labled with the corresponding arrow keys
    
      Game Itself
        Attach keyboard binds and make sure that arrow keys are connected to the buttons
        Create the light up effect for buttons when they are pressed down 
        Also attach an audio to the buttons 
        Create the sequence of keys that needs to be pressed each round. 
          Create a randomizer that generates numbers from 1-4. 
            1 will be up key, 2 will be left etc. 
        At the beginning of the round, the whole list must be played by the computer.  (function)
        
        
    







  Click on something (?) asking keyboard presses for each color???
Empty list - randomizer -> color - append to the list -> show the colors on the list 
Add a timer at the top of the page to show how many seconds does the player have to answer 
Order and there will be “rounds” 
** And the difficulty (aka the number of colors you need to click on) increases over time. 
- Sound element on each ‘lighting up’ 
- When you lose, we wanna have a special lose sound 
Speed +
